Yet, there are plentiful user stories in which very powerful people are protected by deniability in combination with their ability to manipulate media, corrupt courts, etc.  \r\n\r\nI'd thus tentatively conclude that deniability is actually harmful when widely deployed because deniability can only protect powerful people from powerless people, and almost never the reverse.  There is a similar argument that deniability enables framing more often than claims of being framed can provide protection.\r\n\r\nAlso, it appears deniability can always be broken post-compromise because one party could transition their conversation end into a secure enclave, thanks to forward secrecy.  In a legal setting, you cannot even protect both side by running both ends in a secure enclave from the beginning. \r\n\r\nIt's possible deniability serves some use cases among people of approximately equal power.  As an example, a family member who engages in a behavior another family member considers distasteful being able to lie to another family member who discovers their messages.  It's questionable if such defenses really work much in practice, but they do not appear nearly as unlikely as when the two parties differ in power. \r\n\r\nAvoiding signatures has use cases in automated communications, like in extremely low CPU settings, but maybe that's beyond the project scope.

          "body": "One of the problems with the term \"deniability\" (or \"repudiation\", a term I'm more accustomed to) is that it is often debated without any specific scope. It's fine to hold someone accountable *in a context*; it's another thing entirely to make that accountability immediately and permanently global. I am fine sending a message to my bank that I can't deny *to my bank*; I am not necessarily fine with the idea that the bank can show that message to any arbitrary third party that they choose, whenever they choose, under whatever circumstances they choose, without telling me, just because the communication used MLS. They undoubtedly have third-party audit requirements--but I want them to have to ask me to go on the record for auditors, and I want to be able to send an MLS message to them that doesn't give away that freedom until I've formally consented.\r\n\r\nThe Hyperledger community, and in particular the Aries and Indy projects (which would like to use the MLS standard when it is mature enough) requires repudiation (meaning the ability to deny origin to anybody except the intended recipient of a message) as an option. Their analysis of its importance is here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/master/text/0037-repudiation/README.md. A pithy summary is these two sentences:\r\n\r\n```If Alice tells a secret to Carol, who should decide whether the secret is reshared--Alice, or Carol? In an SSI paradigm, the proper, desirable default is that a sender of secrets should retain the ability to decide if their secrets are shareable, not give that guarantee away.```\r\n\r\nI don't disagree with @burdges that deniability can make certain abuses worse--but I do disagree with a premise in some earlier comments, which is that because human power imbalances will inevitably exist, we should build into the MLS architecture a kludge that removes precision and power from the system. That line of thinking would have us eliminate strong encryption, too, since abusive governments are better key management and sophisticated configuration choices than private individuals.\r\n\r\nWhat we should do instead is create technology that's just as easy and safe to use for a peon as for a powerful government or corporation--technology that makes it clear when a message is sent whether it is repudiable, so abusers of power can be held accountable for bad behavior instead of letting them throw up their hands and say, \"Sorry, we had to demand that you talk to us on the record, because that's the only thing the technology allows.\" If all MLS messages are non-repudiable, there is only on-the-record communication, which eliminates whistleblowing and #MeToo reporting.\r\n",

      "body": "```Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI've read over the architecture draft and put together some thoughts\r\nthat came to mind. Some are just small typos while others are a bit more\r\nsubstantial. Feel free to incorporate, ignore or talk to me about whatever!\r\n\r\n- Jo\u00ebl\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------- Comments on MLS Architecture --------------------\r\n\r\n- Abstract : \"It is meant to protect against eavesdropping, tampering,\r\nand message forgery.\" This omits PCS and FS which, IMO, is quite central\r\nto what we are doing. Thus, already in the abstract, I'd add something\r\nreferring/hinting to FS and PCS (e.g. protecting against \"past or future\r\ndevice compromises\" or something else along those lines). The same goes\r\nfor the Introduction as it currently also only talks about E2E security.\r\nAfter all, for the security notions outlined in the abstract and intro\r\n(i.e. basic E2E authentication and privacy) we could use MUCH simpler\r\nprotocols (e.g. a static group key decided upon during group setup. Even\r\njust FS would be much easier E.g. a hash ratchet would do the trick.).\r\nThis, is why I believe much (most?) of what we are doing (on the\r\nprotocol level at least) is about getting PCS and FS on top of the usual\r\nE2E security. Despite this, as far as I can tell the first mention of FS\r\nand PCS are only in 2.3.5 under the heading \"Membership and offline\r\nmembers\".\r\n\r\n\r\n- It is not really clear to me why we require the Authentication Service\r\n(AS) to issue credentials binding identities to keys. I believe this\r\nshould be optional. In particular, if users are able to ensure this\r\nbinding on their own (e.g. using an external authenticated channel to,\r\nsay, comparing key fingerprints or scan each others 2D barcodes) then it\r\ndoes not seem necessary to have the AS provide these credentials. My\r\nconcern is that by not making this optional we are more restrictive than\r\nreally need be. Ultimately what the MS should do is provide *some*\r\nmechanism for verifying the binding of identities to keys. Whether its\r\nvia certificates from an AS attesting to the binding or some other\r\nmechanism performed by end users them selves seems less important to the\r\nrest of the MLS protocol.\r\n\r\n- I'm not a fan of having the DS do key storage for initial key material\r\nbut have the AS store member (public) key material. (I also think the AS\r\nshould store client public keys along with member identity (public)\r\nkeys.) In general, to me a natural logical separation is that the AS is\r\nin charge of public key storage and dissemination while the DS handles\r\nof storage (buffering) and dissemination of traffic. Additionally, some\r\nissues with the current division of labor between the AS and DS that\r\ncould then be avoided are:\r\n    - Its not clear why ordering for the storage of initial key material\r\nshould matter.\r\n        - 3.1.5 \"The DS must only persist data required for the delivery\r\nof messages and avoid Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or other\r\nsensitive metadata wherever possible.\" This sentence doesn't seem very\r\ncompatible to me with the DS also persistently maintaining initial keys;\r\nespecially together with credentials ultimately binding them to a member\r\n(or at least client's) identity.\r\n\r\n- At the meeting in Paris we very brief discussed that it could\r\neventually make sense to have \"the server\" maintain some of the group\r\nstate on behalf of clients (but, of course, without introducing any\r\ntrust in the server beyond the current \"universal ordering\" and \"no-DOS\"\r\nassumptions). With that in mind it may eventually make sense to mention\r\nthis role as part of the DS's tasks. Alternatively, this could be\r\nconsidered part of the AS's role or even a third service exclusive to\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\n- 2.3.1 I'd specify that the initial *public* key material is stored\r\nwith the DS.\r\n\r\n- 2.3.1 I don't see why the AS should be involved in binding the Client\r\nkeys to the Member keys. It should suffice for the Client public key to\r\nbe signed by owning member's keys. As far as I can tell this doesn't\r\ninvolve the AS.\r\n\r\n- I think a brief, 1 or 2 sentences clarifying key material names would\r\nbe helpful. Something like: a member has one pair of long term \"identity\r\nkeys\", a client has one pair of medium term \"client keys\" and many short\r\nterm \"initial keys\". For example, this could come right after the\r\nconcepts of Member's vs. Clients is introduced.\r\n\r\n- 3.1.4 \"affect the group state\". IMO the transcript (i.e. chat history)\r\nis part of group state. So appending a message to the transcript is a\r\ngroup state change. I guess what is meant here is the group's metadata?\r\nGiven that this metadata is also referred to in other places (e.g.\r\n3.1.5) would it make sense to include a sentence or two somewhere making\r\na bit clearer the terms \"group state\",  \"group metadata\" and \"group's\r\nprivate content\" (as used in 3.2.2 for e.g.). In any case the difference\r\nbetween \"state\" in 3.1.4 vs. \"metadata\" in 3.1.5 isn't too clear to me.\r\n\r\n- 3.1.5.  \"A Messaging Service provider that has control over both the\r\nAS and the DS, will not be able to correlate encrypted messages\r\nforwarded by the DS, with the initial public keys signed by the AS.\"\r\nThis seems like a very strong property to shoot for. (Also, given the\r\ndiscussion in Paris, deniability didn't seem to be a serious goal of\r\nMLS.) At the very least it would require the protocol packets not to be\r\nlinkable to long term identities (OK but we must be careful with\r\nsignatures) but also that the DS authenticate clients via (pseudonymous)\r\nidentities. After all, if the DS does not identify clients at all, say,\r\nwhen they request packets buffered in some queue) then, at the very\r\nleast, traffic analysis becomes too easy to perform (or alternatively\r\nDOS attacks become too easy if the queue is emptied). So just to be\r\nsure, is deniability with respect to compromised AS and DS really what\r\nwe mean here?\r\n\r\n- 3.1.7 typo: the word \"messages\" is repeated.\r\n\r\n- 3.2.2 Message Integrity and Authentication: \"and that one Client must\r\nnot be able to send a message which other Clients accept as being from\r\nanother Client.\" This seems weaker than what we want and get (from both\r\nthe ART and TreeKEM drafts). Instead, we want that \"no coalition of\r\nClients can send a message which other Clients accept as being from a\r\nClient not already part of that coalition.\" A similar change should be\r\nmade to the first sentence in 3.2.2.5 and 4.4.\r\n\r\n- 3.2.2.1 \"MLS provides additional protection regarding secrecy of past\r\nmessages and future messages.\" I suggest changing this to \"...regarding\r\nsecrecy and authenticity of past...\" Especially in the PCS case\r\nauthenticity is just as much a goal as privacy. But also for past\r\n(undelivered) messages when compromising a sender we still expect (and\r\nget) authenticity. In particular the sending keys are already deleted so\r\nthe attacker is expected to not be able to create an alternative\r\nciphertext for that AEAD encryption key. In more detail, authenticity\r\nshould also be mentioned (next to privacy) in the more detailed\r\nparagraphs on FS and PCS in that subsection.\r\n\r\n- 3.2.2.1 The PCS version described here is too strong. MLS really only\r\nguarantees PCS if between time t and t' the attacker did not forge a\r\nmessage on behalf of the compromised client. (Not only can a forged\r\nmessage not be prevented by MLS, it also causes the compromised client's\r\nstate to come out of sync with the rest of the group.) So instead, one\r\nsolution is to say something like \"MLS provides PCS security when the\r\nattacker remains passive between times t and t'\". Although this is a\r\nsomewhat stronger restriction on the adversary than we really need to\r\nget PCS it is a clear, succinct yet still reasonable notion we do satisfy.)\r\n\r\n- 3.2.2.1 \"Regardless, MLS does not allow addition or removal of group\r\nmembers without informing all other members.\" Out of curiosity is this\r\nreally true for ART and TreeKEM? Suppose A, B and C are in a group. A is\r\ncorrupt so she sends a add-member message to B informing B that D has\r\njoined the group. We specified that the DS shouldn't \"know\" about group\r\nmembership so it should permit forwarding this only to B. A priori, now\r\nB thinks D is in the group but C doesn't right? In fact, if B sends\r\nmessage to the group (not maybe an update though) its not clear to me\r\nthat C will realize B thinks D is in the group... Worse, D will actually\r\nbe able to decrypt the message. In fact, if D gets their hands on a\r\nmessages sent by C they could also decrypt them (at least before an\r\nupdate occurs) since they are protected only by the group key which D\r\nknows. Any way, it might just be me, but I'm not too clear if, or at\r\nleast, to which extent or in which sense we really get this property.\r\n\r\n- 3.2.2.3 \"hence slightly weakening the PCS guarantees for attachments.\"\r\nI'd probably phrase this as \"hence potentially extending the time before\r\nPCS guarantees take effect.\" rather than use the term \"weaken\" as its\r\nthe same security notion. (I believe that in crypto papers the terms\r\n\"stronger\" and \"weaker\" are normally used to describe security games\r\nthat strictly imply (or are implie by) each other. But, the parameters t\r\nand t' in PCS are not part of the definition of security game. Rather,\r\nthey are a function of the adversary and all inputs and random coins\r\nused in the security game.)\r\n\r\n- 3.2.2.5 My take on the discussion about deniability in Paris was that\r\nthere was a general consensus that deniability is not an interesting\r\ngoal for MLS because what we could achieve is too weak to be interesting\r\nwhile notions strong enough to be worth it in practice are out of our\r\nreach... but to be sure I'd recommend at least checking the notes from\r\nthe meeting to confirm.\r\n\r\n- 4 First paragraph. Typo: \"in\" repeated twice.\r\n\r\n- 4.1. Realistically we might want to also add leaking meta-data. E.g.\r\nwho talks when to whom and how much they say as well as when updates are\r\nperformed vs messages exchanged.\r\n\r\n- 4.4 \"It will also be able to send messages impersonating the\r\ncompromised Client until the Client updates its keying material (see\r\nSection 3.2.2.1).\" I think, at least if an update has been forged on\r\nbehalf of a compromised Client then even if the Client updates its key\r\nmaterial it still wont be able to send messages. In fact, in this cast\r\nAFAIK A) forging can continue and B) the Client can no longer rejoin the\r\ngroup; at least not without wiping its state completely and re-joining\r\nfrom scratch. If this is true then we might consider adding a caveat to\r\nthe quoted sentence reflecting that updates only recover sending\r\ncapabilities if no update was forged in the meantime.```",

For instance, any member can add or remove another client in a group. This is in contrast to some designs in which there is a single group controller who can modify the group. MLS is compatible with having group administration restricted to certain users, but we assume that those restrictions are enforced by authentication and access control at the application layer. Thus, for instance, while it might be cryptographically possible for any member to send a message adding a new client to a group, the group might have the policy that only certain members are allowed to make changes and thus other members can ignore or reject such a message from an unauthorized user.\r\n\r\nIsn't the last sentence overly prescriptive of how group messaging applications that implement MLS might handle unauthorized user actions? The current wording makes it sound like members (i.e, users) themselves are responsible for ignoring/rejecting unauthorized user messages, which seems not quite right. \r\n\r\nIf applications will actually handle enforcing these policies as part of their UX, I recommend changing the last sentence to something like \"Thus, for instance, while the MLS protocol allows for any existing member of a group to add a new client, the group messaging application which implements MLS might allow for group administration policies for which only a subset of members can qualify, and thus will handle enforcing group policies (such as determining if a user is allowed to add new users to the group) at the application level.\"\r\n\r\n",

Not sure but just ratchet a new signing key and broadcast its next public key with every message sent (or even only once in a while)... I might be wrong but it might just be the cost of one crypto operation on send/receive and storing N keys which would be super easy.\r\n\r\nOf course I'll follow the general opinion, but I am curious... :)",

This seems generally very difficult to achieve. It may be possible at times, but does not seem to be grounded in discussions that we have had at the working group meetings.\r\n- Note that federation requires compatible wire encodings.\r\n- Note that communication with the AS requires TLS or alternative authentication.\r\n- Note that out-of-band channels may facilitate detection of misbehaviour. \r\n- Some grammar fixes.",

When it is in a group, it is called a Member. As a User, you can have a lot of Devices and on each devices you may have a lot of groups (hence members) and a lot of potentially unused clients.\r\n\r\nMy advice is to wait until the interim and focus on the protocol document terminology for now, hopefully I'll have time to update the architecture by then...",
